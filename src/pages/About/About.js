        <p>
          I created this website for two reasons. First, I wanted to educate
          people on what they can do to protect their online identity, which is
          ever-increasingly being linked to our real-world identity. I remember
          when the internet first began and anonymity fostered connection,
          learning, curiosity, and freedom of expression. Because we can never
          go back, I am seeking to pave a way forward that allows both users and
          IT professionals alike to protect their real-world identity from
          online attack. Identity theft, cyberstalking, and financial ruin are
          some of the consequences of not knowing how to protect our digital
          privacy. I created this site both to educate people on how to do just
          that while striving to protect my own. The Privacy Dev is a brand that
          was created to protect my own identity while show-casing my work in
          software development. I am currently studying cybersecurity to further
          my ability and mission to protect digital data and intellectual
          curiosity.
